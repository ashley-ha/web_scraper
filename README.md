My webscraper using BeautifulSoup 
Scraping Numbers from HTML using BeautifulSoup 
  In this assignment I wrote a Python program similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllink2.py. The program uses urllib to read the HTML from the data files, and parse the data, extracting numbers and computing the sum of the numbers in the given file.
